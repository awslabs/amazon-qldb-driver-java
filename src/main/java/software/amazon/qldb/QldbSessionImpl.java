/**
 * Represents a session to a specific ledger within QLDB, allowing for execution of PartiQL statements and
 * retrieval of the associated results, along with control over transactions for bundling multiple executions.
 *
 * The execute methods provided will automatically retry themselves in the case that an unexpected recoverable error
 * occurs, including OCC conflicts, by starting a brand new transaction and re-executing the statement within the new
 * transaction.
 *
 * There are three methods of execution, ranging from simple to complex:
 *  - {@link #execute(String)} and {@link #execute(String, List)} allow for a single statement to be executed within a
 *    transaction where the transaction is implicitly created and committed, and any recoverable errors are
 *    transparently handled.
 *  - {@link #execute(Executor, RetryIndicator)} and {@link #execute(ExecutorNoReturn, RetryIndicator)} allow for
 *    more complex execution sequences where more than one execution can occur, as well as other method calls. The
 *    transaction is implicitly created and committed, and any recoverable errors are transparently handled.
 *    {@link #execute(Executor)} and {@link #execute(ExecutorNoReturn)} are also available, providing the same
 *    functionality as the former two functions, but without a lambda function to be invoked upon a retriable exception.
 *  - {@link #startTransaction()} allows for full control over when the transaction is committed and leaves the
 *    responsibility of OCC conflict handling up to the user. Transactions' methods cannot be automatically retried, as
 *    the state of the transaction is ambiguous in the case of an unexpected error.
