# Amazon QLDB Driver for Java
This package provides an interface to [Amazon QLDB](https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/) for Java.

With the Amazon QLDB Driver for Java you can create a session with connectivity to a specific ledger in QLDB. This 
session enables you to execute PartiQL statements and retrieve the results of those statements. You can also take 
control over transactions to group multiple executions within a transaction.
