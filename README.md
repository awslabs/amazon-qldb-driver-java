This is the Java driver for [Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)](https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/), which allows Java developers to write software that makes use of Amazon QLDB.

Version 1.x is still supported.

For getting started with the driver, see [Java and Amazon QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started.java.html).

## Requirements

To use the Amazon QLDB Driver for Java, you'll need **Java 1.8+**. For more information about Amazon QLDB Driver for Java requirements, see [Amazon QLDB Driver for Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started.java.html) in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide.

### Basic Configuration

See [Accessing Amazon QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/accessing.html) for information on connecting to AWS.

## Getting Started

Please see the [Quickstart guide for the Amazon QLDB Driver for Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/driver-quickstart-java.html).

1. **Sign up for AWS** &mdash; Before you begin, you need an AWS account. For more information about creating an AWS account and retrieving your AWS credentials, see [Accessing Amazon QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/accessing.html) in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide.
1. **Install the QLDB driver** &mdash; The driver binaries are in Maven Central. For more information, see [Amazon QLDB documentation for the Java driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started.java.html#getting-started.java.quickstart) section of the Amazon QLDB documentation for the Java Driver.
